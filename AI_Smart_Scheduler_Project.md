# AI-Driven Smart Scheduling and Reminder System

## **Problem Statement**
Managing schedules, appointments, and deadlines can be challenging for individuals and businesses alike. 
Many existing systems lack intelligence and flexibility to handle dynamic schedules, prioritize tasks, 
or integrate seamlessly with external systems like calendars or messaging platforms.

## **Proposed Solution**
Develop an **AI-driven smart scheduling and reminder system** that helps users:
1. **Optimize Schedules**: Automatically adjust tasks based on priority, time constraints, and availability.
2. **Send Timely Reminders**: Notify users about upcoming tasks or events via multiple channels (email, SMS, push notifications).
3. **Integrate with External Systems**: Sync with Google Calendar, Microsoft Outlook, or CRM systems.
4. **Provide Insights**: Analyze user activity to recommend better scheduling habits or optimize resource allocation for businesses.

## **Real-World Applications**
1. **Freelancers/Consultants**:
   - Manage project deadlines, client meetings, and personal schedules seamlessly.
2. **Businesses**:
   - Optimize team schedules for meetings, deadlines, and resource allocation.
3. **Healthcare**:
   - Help clinics manage appointments and send patient reminders.
4. **Education**:
   - Notify students about assignment deadlines and class schedules.

## **Key Features**

### **1. User Onboarding & Preferences**
- Allow users to:
  - Set working hours.
  - Define notification preferences (e.g., "Remind me 1 hour before").
  - Add recurring tasks/events.

### **2. Task Scheduling**
- **Manual Scheduling**:
  - Users can manually add tasks/events.
- **Automated Optimization**:
  - Reorder tasks dynamically based on:
    - Deadlines.
    - Estimated completion time.
    - Priority level.
  - For example:
    - If Task A is delayed, automatically reschedule Task B.

### **3. Calendar Integration**
- Sync with external calendars (Google Calendar, Outlook).
- Merge external events with internal schedules.
- Two-way sync: Allow updates from either platform.

### **4. Smart Notifications**
- Send reminders:
  - Emails for detailed reminders.
  - SMS for urgent notifications.
  - Push notifications for instant updates.
- Include actionable details (e.g., "Meeting with John Doe in 15 minutes. Hereâ€™s the Zoom link").

### **5. Advanced Features**
- **Conflict Detection**:
  - Notify users of overlapping tasks/events.
  - Suggest alternative slots.
- **Resource Optimization**:
  - For businesses, optimize team schedules to reduce idle time.
- **Insights**:
  - Recommend best times for meetings (e.g., "Your productivity is highest at 10 AM").

## **Flow of the System**

1. **User Adds/Syncs Events**:
   - User adds events/tasks manually or syncs with an external calendar.

2. **Data Processing**:
   - Celery tasks fetch and analyze schedules.
   - AI models prioritize tasks and resolve conflicts.

3. **Notification Engine**:
   - Celery dispatches reminders/updates to users based on their preferences.

4. **Feedback Loop**:
   - Users can update tasks dynamically, and the system adapts.

## **Business Logic**

### **Freemium Model**
- **Free Tier**:
  - Manual task scheduling.
  - Basic reminders (email only).
- **Premium Tier**:
  - AI-driven optimization.
  - Advanced analytics and insights.
  - SMS and push notifications.
  - Multi-calendar integration.

### **B2B Offerings**
- Sell as a SaaS product to businesses:
  - Help teams manage schedules, deadlines, and meetings.
  - Provide APIs for integration with existing CRMs (e.g., Salesforce).

## **Technical Features**

### **Backend with Celery**
- **Task Queue for Scheduling**:
  - Use Celery Beat to trigger periodic tasks:
    - Recalculate schedules every 30 minutes.
    - Send reminders 10 minutes before events.
- **Notification Handling**:
  - Queue notification tasks to avoid blocking other operations.

### **AI Models**
- **Task Prioritization**:
  - Use machine learning to rank tasks based on:
    - Deadlines.
    - Past completion patterns.
    - User preferences.
- **Time Prediction**:
  - Predict task completion times based on historical data.

### **Horizontal Scaling**
- Add workers to handle spikes in:
  - Notification dispatching.
  - Scheduling recalculations for large user bases.

## **Testing the System**

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Verify core functionalities like adding tasks, syncing calendars, and notification dispatching.

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test external calendar syncing and API integrations.

3. **Load Testing**:
   - Simulate thousands of users with overlapping schedules to ensure the system handles load gracefully.

4. **Mock-Based Testing for Celery**:
   - Use pytest to mock Celery tasks and test their behavior without triggering actual notifications.

## **Next Steps**
1. **Define the Domain**:
   - Focus on individuals or businesses? Niche markets like healthcare or education?
2. **Prototype**:
   - Start with manual scheduling and basic notifications.
3. **Expand**:
   - Add AI-based optimization and advanced integrations.
